In order to build ScriptingLayerForAndroid:

You need to create a classpath variable ANDROID_SDK to point to the SDK folder.
Window-->Preferences-->Java-->Build Path-->Classpath Variables

(ie, Name: ANDROID_SDK Path: C:/Program Files (x86)/Android/android-sdk )
(The location of your SDK will vary.)

To rebuild the documentation, you should also set the classpath variable JDK to point to the Java development kit
(ie: Name: JDK Path: C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_24)

Project-->Clean-->All (this may need to be run several times)

Common Problems:
QuickAction is a library. Sometimes different versions of the eclipse or the ADT will have difficulty finding it.
A common symptom is a DalvikVM error when you attempt to build or deploy.

To fix:
Right click on ScriptingLayerForAndroid-->Build Path-->Configure Build Path-->Android
Down the bottom of the screen is a reference list. Remove the reference to QuickAction (if it exists) then:
Add-->QuickAction.

Then Project Clean to make sure the change is picked up.
